# liquidity &#128167;
*Reactive Typescript bindings and a simple API for @ethereum/solidity.*

## What is `liquidity`?
Liquidity is a (work in progress) api/wrapper for web3 and allowing it to interact in a smooth-er fashion with your application.

## Why liquidity?
Solidity is the smart contract language for the ethereum blockchain. Solids, however, are usually not very reactive. 
When interacting with liquid, it moves, something happens, it reacts. The idea for liquidity is that we can have a simple wrapper
in web3, that can interact with contracts (`*.sol`) in a ***reactive*** way. Due to that concept, this project was coined "liquidity".
